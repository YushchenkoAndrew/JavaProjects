# All my Java Projects

Here you can find (kinda) almost anything, starting from a simple learning with a language and finishing some custom made libs (for MatrixMath, NeuralNetwork, GUI).

Plus this repo push me on direction of Computer Graphics Algorithm and I realized why the heck I've learned Matrix Math, so it have a special place in my heart.
